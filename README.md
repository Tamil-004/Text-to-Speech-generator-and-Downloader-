Your CSS code sets the stage for a text-to-speech converter webpage. It begins with a universal selector reset, ensuring consistent styling across elements, followed by the definition of a `.hero` class for the main section. This class creates a visually engaging background using an image, applying flexbox properties to center its content vertically and horizontally. The styles for the heading and textarea elements provide a cohesive look, maintaining readability and visual appeal. Additionally, the rules for the button and select dropdown ensure intuitive user interaction. Lastly, media queries enhance responsiveness, adjusting element widths for optimal display on various devices, thus creating a seamless and user-friendly experience across different screen sizes.

Your HTML project, "Text To Speech Converter - GreatStack," succinctly captures the purpose of the webpage and possibly the name of the platform or project ("GreatStack") hosting the converter. The project effectively communicates to users that the webpage offers a tool for converting text into speech. The inclusion of "GreatStack" suggests a brand or platform identity, which can help users recognize and remember the source of the service. Overall, the project efficiently conveys essential information about the webpage's functionality and potential affiliation.
